Task: Banking System Simulation
You're simulating a banking system where multiple users (clients) can deposit and withdraw money from a shared bank account.
The goal is to ensure thread safety in a multi-threaded environment, so transactions don’t conflict and the final balance remains accurate.

Requirements:

    Create a shared BankAccount class with methods for deposit and withdraw.
    Create multiple threads representing different clients. Each client thread will:
        Randomly decide to either deposit or withdraw an amount between $10 and $100.
        Perform this transaction 5 times.
    Use thread synchronization to ensure thread safety on the bank account’s balance.
    Print each transaction (including deposits and withdrawals), and, after all transactions are complete, print the final account balance.
Additional Notes:
    If a thread attempts to withdraw more money than is available, it should display a message saying the withdrawal failed due to insufficient funds.
    Start with a balance of $1000 in the bank account.
